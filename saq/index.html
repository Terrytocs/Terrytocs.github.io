              <b>Q:</b> Why'd you change your site from the way it was before?
              It used to be way more modern.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>A:</b> Blame
              <a class="link" href="neocities.org">neocities</a>. Their old
              school, 2000's-style websites just sing to me ^_^.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Follow-up Q:</b> Why didn't you just put it on neocities then?
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Follow-up A:</b> Honestly, I don't know. Maybe I will...
              eventually.

              <b>Q:</b> You do know that unnesseccary is spelt incorrectly in
              the explanation for unnesecary, right?

            <p>
              <b>A:</b> Mostly online, and I also got training in
              web-development from the

            <p><b>Q:</b> How can you be contacted?</p>
            <p>
              <b>A:</b> I have a <a class="link" href="">Discord</a> that I
              barely use, but I can be contacted there. I'd really love to work
              with someone on a project some time.

            <p>
              <b>A:</b> They may be broken, or dead, or I just can't remember
              where to find the URL.

            <p><b>Q:</b> Your website isn't responsive.</p>
            <p>
              <b>A:</b> That's not a question! Plus, you shouldn't be
              web-surfing on mobile anyway &gt;_&lt;!
