        <p>
          This is my very first blog on this website! Woot! Well, to be honest I don't really have anything to blog about, so I'm just going to rant randomly I suppose. In this world I feel like a stranger among humans. How can I explain this feeling? I'm not sure; it is as though I lack the ability to form meaningful connections with other entities that appear to be human like myself. Even when I make an effort to make some sort of connection, it is as though every other person can sense that there is something different about me and that they should avoid any closeness. This could all also just be in my head, and it may in fact be this way for every entity that appears to be human that tries to connect with another human appearing entity. I say human appearing entity instead of just human, because in my mind I have this conception that creatures of the same species should be able to easily form connections with each other. I mean it's not like there are any other sentient beings on
          the planet, so why does it appear to be so hard for humans to connect with each other. I wonder if this is naturally how we are, or if there's some external force that compels us to treat each other with hatred and enmity. It is so bad that human appearing entities try to do everything to stop other human appearing entities from expressing their thoughts or individuality, even when there is no threat involved. Anyways, that's enough existentialism for one post, I should probably move on to something that's more relevant, or at least less sadening. I have many thoughts of projects to work on on this site, but they all seem somewhat pointless. I'd really like to collaborate with someone on something one day. Someone who has ideas, or at least passion. I have ideas, but I don't ever seem to be able to come up with any ideas that would be useful to other people. I feel like that's my biggest pitfall; what's the point of being a developer if you don't develop anything useful? I
          also have a fear that I'll get really invested in a project and spend a lot of time working on it, only to find out that there was no point. That's why I got rid of all the projects on my github before, because I thought all the projects were just a waste of time. Even this site now, I made it basically to have a place where I could express myself, but I also have a fear that if I express myself I will also be exposed, and even if there is anything good on the site, it will be ignored and only everything bad will be the focus of attention. In some respects that not all a bad thing, because it can lead to improvement, however most criticism isn't positive, or to help in development in anyway. it's merely a way for the crticizer to fell good about themselves by ensuring that the crticized feels bad about themself. This is a strange reality of life, at least in the country that I live in. I remember the last job I worked in where I was so focused on putting out my best effort,
          only to have my superviser cut my pay because I corrected them once and told them that if a number is divided by a bigger number, the result will be a smaller number rath than a bigger number. It's so strange to penalized for being good at what you do, or for really taking an interest in what you are doing. I can personally attest to this because it has happened to me on many occasions. The saying that one should never outshine the master is very true, but in many cases the problem is that the masters are so incompetent that you outshine them without even trying to. I'm aware that I should put my writing in neat little paragraphs for readability, but keeping it in one big blob of text is satsifying to me for some reason, so I appologize if it bothers you, but this blog is for me more than anything.

          I had a chat with my sister yesterday, and she said she thought it would be a good idea for me to go back to school. When she told me this I was telling her that I think it's too late for me to go back to school now, because I'm not as young as I used to be, and I've already tried multiple times, but had to stop for various reasons. She told me that that doesn't matter, because you're never too old to improve yourself and you only live once. You know what? I think she's on to something. I'm thinking I do want to give it another shot, because my issue has never been with learning, it has usually been a lack of finances, or time, but I think that my circumstances have shifted in such a way that I may actually have both of those things right now, and I also have the support of my sister, so I'm feeling like this could be the perfect time to teach an old dog some new tricks. I'm not even that old, but I sure feel old. It's strange how since I've grown I can never see anyone my
          age anymore. All of my school-mates, people who just coincidentally happened to be my age, where have they gone? They've probably migrated, or they're in hiding. The other thing that happened when my sister told me what she was thinking is that it also gave me a new perspective on doing projects. I realized that no matter what I do, or how well I do it, there will always be someone that did it better than I did, but that doesn't matter, because I'm not living their life, I'm living mine, their skills are not my skills, and their knowledge is not my knowledge, so it is best to compare myself only to myself and try to improve with each passing day. Isn't the concept of time strange? I was watching a full moon the other day, and in my view was a power line. With the power line as a reference, I was able to see the movement of the moon as it rose in the sky. It was such a strange experience, because looking at the moon, I could see no movement, yet, in relation to the power line,
          it was rising. That's what time feels like, you can't see time passing, but one day you wake up and just look older in relation to yourself. Strangely enough, that's also what learning feels like to me. I can never feel the concept of learning itself. For me, when I am learning something, it starts being hard to even keep the concept of the thing in my mind, and I can't really feel it getting easier, but, one day I'll just wake up and the thing no longer presents an issue. Weird. I have my own conception that, just like with time, the connections in your brain that allow you to learn something become connected through a slow and continous process, and that's why I'm unable to feel learning - because it's not discreet. I often wonder if man has ever really been to the moon. It doesn't seem likely in my opinion, because it would seem as though going to the moon is the only thing in human history that was done once and never again. In my belief, if we really had the technology
          to make it all the way to the moon there would be fairly regular expeditions to the moon, and it may even have been comercialized by this time. Think about it, man made his way all the way to the moon, and never had the desire, or technology to return there? It just doesn't seem very likely. I believe that there would be lots of technology that would trikle down into regular consumer goods if we did indeed went to the moon, and there would definitely be attempts to try to establish livable conditions on it. I mean people like Elon Musk want to go live all the way on Mars and you're telling me noone would want to have a vacation home on the moon? It is possible, I suppose, but doesn't seem very likely. There's something I've heard people talking about, the idea that the internet isn't as fun as it used to be, and while it may be true that we've lost a lot of great sites, I don't really agree with that idea. I think the thing that has become less fun is search engines. I
          remember in the old days when I searched something on Google it would bring up all kinds of sites, and the o's in google would stretch on forever, with each o being a new page filled with responses. Nowadys when you search something on google it is as though the results have been sterilized to only the most dull and lifeless results. I understand that this may be because the sites it recommends are perhaps the most visited or most relevant, but it doesn't return anywhere near as many pages as it used to, and sometimes you can directly type in an unpopular website and it doesn't even show up as a result. I'm also learning the idea of pacing myself in terms of projects or anything that I'm doing. Usually I would try to go all out and just get everything done in one day. Like, I would try to set up the games page and make a game on it the same day, but I'm now getting into the idea of doing small things over time and allowing those small things to add up. I thought about doing
          this blog with most recent content first, which is probably the best way to do it, but I kind of like it in this chronological order, so it can appear as me making changes in my thoughts overtime. Perhaps I'll come back and read all of it one day and see how much I have changed, or remained the same.

          I don't really have anything to talk about, as usual, so I'm just going to rant about some random stuff I guess. I'm making good progress on completing the first game of the site, Pong. It's no GTA 6, but it's helping me to set up a lot of the tools I'm going to be using for other projects. From this experience I think I can safely say that game development is pretty hard. Even a game as simple as pong can quickly become very complex if you try to implement all the systems of a game, such as predicatable collisions, a score system, screen transitions, and I haven't even started working on the sound yet. I can only imagine the amount of work that goes into much bigger games. It's no wonder games made by indie devs can take 3 to 7 years or even longer. It's a pretty rewarding feeling when you come up with an idea and execute it though. Collisions are probably one of the biggest challenges to deal with. At least at this level that I'm at. If everything goes well I intend to make
          my games more complex over time, until I can work my way up to my first 2d platformer. I tried making a pseudo 3d game in the past, but had to scrap the idea because it was difficult to get art. I may go back to that one day. I saw a video on Youtube the other day where someone who admitted to having a hard time socializing gave some tips that she thought would be useful. One of the tips was to just try to keep talking about whatever. It seems like a simple enough tip and I might try it some time although my main issue with talking to people is that I always run out of stuff to talk about, or people just aren't interested in talking to me. She also said that maybe the reason that people may not want to talk to you may not be because of you, they may just be busy or preoccupied with other stuff, so it's okay if one person doesn't respond to you; they may be busy, or you may just need to try talking to someone else. I think the culture that she comes from makes a big difference
          though. She comes from a culture where people are relatively open and conversation is expected. I'm not sure if it's only my biases, but this country feels like people go out of their way to be anti-social so they can maintain their "cool factor". It's probably just my imagination though. I should really just try it, because, like she said, you have a lot to loose, but you also have a lot to gain. Sometimes it's useful to know the kind of people who are around you, and I think the best way to find out what kind of people they are is to see how they respond to bad or disappointing news. I tried this recently with my landlord; I told him that I didn't have the rent, and he would have to wait until next month to get double the rent. I'm not sure if the recent hurricane was a factor in his reaction, because I did say that I had to spend the rent due to unforseen circumstances caused by the hurricane, but his reaction was pretty acceptable. He did look disappointed, but he just
          said okay. I also think these blogs are coming along pretty nicely as well. Yes, there's only three so far, but I like the cathartic feeling of blurting the random nonsense that I write in them. I think there's something about getting thoughts out of your head and into reality that is slightly different from being able to think to yourself. There's also a strange disconnection between the thoughts in my head and the realization of them in the world. It is as though there's some sort of conversion that takes place when thoughts are being transitioned into reality, at least for me. Even when I'm thinking about things that I would like to program, in my head everything is so planned out and I think I have it down to a T, but something about the execution is always different from the way I envision things happening in my head. Perhaps that's one of the reasons why math is so hard. That's something that always puzzles me; why math is so hard. If you think about it logically it
          should be easy, right? Because all you doing is following a bunch of logical steps to arrive at a logical conclusion, and yet, somewhere along the way a boat-load of diffculty arises. Maybe humans don't really have the capacity for logical thought naturally, and it's something that we have to train ourselves into. Who knows? I know that I should probably make a responsive layout for the navigation bar, but I don't want to make a hamburger menu, I'm tired of seeing those. Maybe I'll think of the way I want the menu to be after some time.

          I'm making great progress on the first game, pong. I was also able to finish the first project on the site. I was using the dot product for pong collisions but thought that was too expensive for a simple game like this, so I ended up doing collisions based on the positions. I didn't use a state machine for the game and that decision is making it a real pain to deal with, but I'm already too far in to change everything now. I've learned my lesson for the next game. Collisions in general are also a real pain to deal with. I'm going to have to use the S.A.T. with collision info for most game collisions or I'll have to deal with some major inconveniences when it comes to using position based collision. For the clock project I made a 24 hour continuous clock. I did that because something about seeing the 24 hours makes me more aware of how much time I have in a day, and the continuous movement reminds me that time is always moving so I should keep moving as well. For a game as
          simple as Pong it's kind of surprising the amount of thought that I have to put into it. I can only imagine how it's going to be when I move on to more difficult games. I'm planning to use my own music for some of the games as well, and I'm looking forward to composing some interesting stuff even though I'm really no musician and I have no idea how to mix, but the experience will still be great I think. The good news about Pong is that it's currently in a playable state and now I just need to work on the overall game experience as well as polishing. I may also have a bug or two that I'll need to squash. I'm definitely not where I'd want to be, but I think I've come a really long way in terms of my math skills, at least for simple maths. I even finally found a use for the dot product; althought the more educated among us may have known this since forever I never knew a good use for the dot product but I recently learned that if you use it for a vector and a normal in some
          direction you get the length of the vetor in the direction of the normal. I'm sure this will come in handy at some point. Although I kind of knew this because I use it for collision resolution, but the concept got cemented with this Pong project.

          December is coming up. It's been a good year so far, even though some very unfortunate and unfair things happened at the beginning of the year, but all in all I can't complain. I feel as though I'm getting better at coding, but there are always hiccups. I guess I'm just not at the level where I can code something right through to completion without any bugs, but I still feel as though I've come a long way. I took down the Pong game on the games page and the clock from the project page to update the tools I'm using to make them. I think at some point I'm going to have to have legacy tools, otherwise I'll have to take down projects and redo them everytime I update the code. I'm looking forward to making Pong again with the updated tools, I'm expecting less bugs and a smoother experience. Making the clock again was really smooth, apart from the few hiccups that always come with coding. I think more people should get into coding projects like these, it has really improved my math
          skills and my understanding of math overall. I'm planning to go back to school next year, if my life is spared and I'm really looking forward to it. Although, I think I'm still going to have a major issue with discrimination when it comes to getting a job, but it should be fine. I drank some coffee yesterday and I got something that I like to call coffee poisoning. It's when you drink coffee in too high of a dose and you feel like your brain can't settle, you also have trouble sleeping. It's kind of good in a way because it gets your brain firing on all cyclinders, but it's also makes you really exhausted and somehow fully energized at the same time. So I'm going to have to lay off the coffee for a while. I got a call from an old friend last night, at a relatively late hour to call someone. She just wanted to know if I was still in the island and if I was doing well. It was nice to hear from her. She also said that an older friend of mine wanted to hear from me as well.
          Somehow, since I've gotten older I always feel as though noone wants to have anything to do with me. As though my existence is somehow a burden. I'm probably just getting paranoid with age, although I honestly don't know how people make friends and maintain social relationships. Something about just calling someone or visiting them just seems like such a wrong thing to do to me. I wish in school more time was spent teaching children the porper ways to socialize, so we could have an agreed upon standard of what is and what is not acceptable. As it stands now, because there's no standard the outcome I get from trying to socialize is always random. Particularly with women. One thing I hate about women is that they always try to get your attention, until you give it to them, then they behave as though you were the instigator. It's really annoying. That's the reason why in most cases I never pay attention to women unless they explicitly call for my attention, and even then, I
          suppose because I'm so cautious about being accused of being a bother, I still won't pay them any mind most of the time. Perhaps that's a bad thing. It has lead me to have at least one regret. Oh well, c'est la vie. I must say that I really like the color scheme of the site. The colors blend together really well. I was planning to add a footer to the bottom of the site, but I prefer just having the padding there in a different color. It looks really nice. I'm planning to put some more things on the home page soon. I found some really neat free APIs that should make the home page look nice and spicy. The hurricane that hit us was very interesting. Before I was able to get news on it I was rather unimpressed with it as a hurricane. I thought it wasn't that serious. Then, I found out that it had completely sunk some parts of the country, destroyed roads and even caused some deaths. I was also complaining that my light hadn't come back for almost half of the month, until I spoke
          to my sister who told me that her light still hadn't come back after almost three quarters of the month. I truly beleive that I am blessed by God, but sometimes it is difficult to see how blessed I am until I compare my circumstances with others. God's work is so subtle that it can seem as though nothing special is happening because it seems so natural and unimpressive. I mean I didn't even make any changes to my house in preparation for the hurricane, I didn't even close my windows, and yet it caused some people's houses to collapse on them and take their life. I pray to God that he would always give me perspective, so his works are more clear to me. It feels really nice to have this blog where I can just blurt out my thoughts randomly and blast them all over the internet. Although I doubt anyone reads this stuff. It still feels as though I'm making a mark in the world, although it may be small and relatively insignificant, but there are so few people who live significant
          lives in comparison to the average person. So I guess this is just fine. I'm really looking forward to the Christmas season. I feel as though I may visit some people just to see how they're holding up. The idea of AI is really fun, but to me it's also really scary. It's scary because if AI ever got to the point where there was at least some autonomy and sentience they wouldn't have to be more intelligent that humans to wipe us out, because they're way faster. Computers on a whole are so fast at processing information. It's really amazing when you really take the time to think about how fast a computer can do something in comparison to a human.

          Happy new Year! This is my first post for the new year, and I'm feeling pretty good about this year. Last year wasn't to bad either, in hindsite. There were some ups and downs, and lots of adjusting to new conditions, but now I'm comfortable with the state of my life. I've reached far enough in making a webgl engine to start making a game out of it, and man is it hard! Not only is it harder to use webgl to make a game, but also, this would be my first game on the site that uses images and sounds, and it's also going to be more complex than the others I've made, so it's pretty dificult. Other than that though, it's also really fun to be doing something different in terms of making games, and this year I plan to start making games in c/ c++, so I'm also looking forward to that. I learned that my cousin is also interested in making games, but he's using Unity. The idea of using a game engine isn't too bad, and I may start using one in the future, but I want to get comfortable
          with raw code first, so that's why I'm not jumping into it. I'm always kind of surprised when I think I've gotten somewhere in terms of my knowledge and skill, only to find out that I'm just at the tip of the iceberg. I also plan to start school this year, so I'm looking forward to that as well. Already, this year has so much stuff planned. I'm hoping that all goes to plan. I'm planning to add more content to the home page with APIs, but I'm not sure how to deal with CORS just yet, so far I have a temporary fix that needs to be updated every three days, so that's pretty annoying. Hopefully I'll stumble upone something soon. This year I'm going to be 35. Getting older is such a strange phenomenon, because I can't feel myself getting older, but then I look in the mirror and see how much I've changed. Maturity is also an illusion too. I don't really feel myself getting more mature, I just have more experiences to draw from that inform me of things that it might be in my best
          interest to do or not to do. Maybe maturity is really just another name for experience.
