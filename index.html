          11/12/25. Hurricane Maria passed, and we're still alive, even though
          we were out of electricity for almost half of the month! We also added
          the blog, games, saq, and projects pages, even though there's nothing
          on them yet... The saq has some stuff at least.

          Welcome, to the home of Ted! Please, enjoy your stay! The site is
          under construction, so check in regularly. This banner is completely
          unnesecary, but it looks cool. I know that unecessary is spelt wrongly
          in the previous sentence, but I'm too lazy to fix it. Even though
          typing this explanation took more time than it would take to fix it.
          Maybe I should just fix it. Then again, if I fixed it, I wouldn't have
          as much things to type in this banner, so it wouldn't be as long and
          important looking. See how everything always works out for the better
          in the end? I should really fix it though. Oh well, c'est la vie... I
          may drop some comments in here, as well as updates from time to time.
          Weeeeee!

          />Welcome, to the home of Theodore (Theo/ Ted) Scott-Henry! You may
          rest here, before continuing your journey. While you wait, let me tell
          you a little about myself. I was born in 1991, yes, the same year as
          Street Fighter II, I am male (he/ him/ his/ they/ them/ their), and
          live in the Caribbean. I enjoy playing video games, web-development,
          making game systems, comics and anime, and web-surfing. This site
          serves as a personal hub to link to various projects that I have
          worked on, will work on, or will be working on. Feel free to peruse to
          your heart's content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Updates are usually done on Sundays, so there should be something new
          each week. Be sure to check out the SAQ for any questions you have.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's not much here yet, but hopefully you can find something
          interesting down below.
